This week was our last ever IT lesson. I worked on my blog to make it look better and then explored other blogs, researching what I could do to improve. Overall I think that Summer IT has really improved my skills and made me better overall at Computing.

I also think that I have learned a lot this term because we had a free reign. We were allowed to create quizzes, explore Buzzfeed and customise our blogs by ourselves. This really improved our confidence. Altogether I think IT is a very good learning experience.
