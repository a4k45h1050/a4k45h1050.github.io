    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I could convert text to binary using Upper and Lower Case letters</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To begin to learn how to break down the concatenated code and learn how to change from 7-bit rate to 8-bit rate. </td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I listened to the demonstration at the front of the classroom and worked independantly. I also looked on Google for splitting down the concatenated code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I followed instructions but I helped people too much. I also left my computer unattended which meant people cam eto my computer and started getting my code and sharing it round. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to fully split concatenated code and not help people as much.</td>
