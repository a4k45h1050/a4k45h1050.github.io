(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>I used the tips to help me get htorugh the levels and I tried to find the shortest way possible, so it stretched my learning, not just pciking the easiest option.</td>

    <td>I think I got mixed up with the arrows because in my eyes they were hard to interpret. This caused my code to go wrong. I also thought that the features PROC 1 and PROC 2 were hard to master but when I did get the hang of it I moved quite quickly with it. </td>

    <td>Next time I would check the code quite a few times before actually playing the game and this will help with spotting mistakes. </td>
