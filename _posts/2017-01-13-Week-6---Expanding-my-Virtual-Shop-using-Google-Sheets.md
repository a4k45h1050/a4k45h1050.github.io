    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To succesfully add a discount function and to try and use discount codes</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I completed most of my target because I had a working discount function but my discount codes do not work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I watched the demonstration and added a basic discount code to my spreadsheet. It looked like this: =I2*(1-H6/100). I then tried to use discount codes but there was an error message. I will try to complete this next lesson  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was focused well and got most of the work done but I felt I helped people a lot so I should work independantly. Doing this may have given me more time to work on the discount codes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will spend more time obn discount codes and work independantly so I can get more done.</td>
